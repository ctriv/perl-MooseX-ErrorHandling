=head1 NAME

MooseX::ErrorHandling - Insert Abstract Here

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    whenMooseThrows CanOnlyConsumeRole => insteadDo {
        My::Exception->new(
            error => $_->message
        );
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an attempt to monkey patch the way Moose handles errors.
Currently Moose throws a number of different exception objects for different
errors.  If you're trying to replace an existing object system with Moose,
suddenly your errors could be very different.

=head1 An Important Disclamer

This module is almost certainly a bad idea, and I'm fairly sure I'm going to
regret putting it on cpan.

=head1 TODO

=item *

Figure out a sane way to do this.
