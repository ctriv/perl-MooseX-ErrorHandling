=head1 NAME

MooseX::ErrorHandling - Insert Abstract Here

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    whenMooseThrows CanOnlyConsumeRole => insteadDo {
        My::Exception->new(
            error => $_->message
        );
    };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an attempt to monkey patch the way Moose handles errors.
Currently Moose throws a number of different exception objects for different
errors.  If you're trying to replace an existing object system with Moose,
suddenly your errors could be very different.

=head1 An Important Disclamer

This module is almost certainly a bad idea, and I'm fairly sure I'm going to
regret putting it on cpan.

=cut

sub whenMooseThrows ($$) {
    my ($type, $cb) = @_;

    # first make sure the exception class is loaded, as we're about to monkey
    # around in it.
    my $exception_class = "Moose::Exception::$type";
    use_package_optimistically($exception_class);

    add_method_modifier($exception_class, 'around', [new => sub {
        my ($orig, $class, @args) = @_;
        local $_ = $class->$orig(@args);
        return $cb->();
    }]);
}

sub insteadDo (&) {
    return shift;
}

Figure out a sane way to do this.
